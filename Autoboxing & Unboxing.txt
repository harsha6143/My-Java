Autoboxing:

The automatic conversion of primitive data type into its corresponding wrapper class is known as autoboxing, for example, byte to Byte, char to Character, int to Integer, long to Long, float to Float, boolean to Boolean, double to Double, and short to Short.

class test {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int a=20;
        Integer i=Integer.valueOf(a);//converting int into Integer explicitly
        Integer j=a;//autoboxing, now compiler will write Integer.valueOf(a) internally
    }
}

unboxing:

The automatic conversion of wrapper type into its corresponding primitive type is known as unboxing. It is the reverse process of autoboxing. Since Java 5, we do not need to use the intValue() method of wrapper classes to convert the wrapper type into primitives.

class test {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Integer a=new Integer(3);
        int i=a.intValue();//converting Integer to int explicitly
        int j=a;//unboxing, now compiler will write a.intValue() internally

    }
}
