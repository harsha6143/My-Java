ArrayList methods       uc : elements are frequently accessed and the size of the list may change      

al.add('a');            add element
al2.addAll(a1);         add elements from existing arraylist
al.get(0);              get element at 0 index
al.set(0,'b');          set element at 0 index
al.remove(0);           remove element at 0 index
al.clear();             remove all elements
al.size();              size of the list
Collections.sort(al)    sorting

LinkedList methods      uc : elemets are frequently added or removed from begining or middle of the list

ll.addFirst('a');       add element at first
ll.addLast('a');        add element at last
ll.removeFirst('a');    remove first element
ll.removeLast('a');     remove last element
ll.getFirst('a');       get first element
ll.getLast('a');        get last element

Stack methods(LIFO)     uc : provide undo mechanism,synchronized

s.push(1);              put element in stack
s.pop();                pop last element
s.peek();               element which is in top

HashSet methods         uc : no duplicates,accending order,can add null, searching is most frequent then go with hashset

hs.contains('a');       true if it contain element

LinkedHashSet           uc : if we want order, no duplicate 

TreeSet methods  

ts.first();             give first element
ts.last();              give last element
ts.headSet(5);          give only smaller elements than 5
ts.tailSet(5);          give higher elements and also 5
ts.subSet(2,8);         give elements which are in the range of 2 and 8
ts.lower(3);            give strictly less element           
ts.floor(3);            give graterst element less or equal to the given element or null in there are no such elements
ts.higher(3);           give strictly grater element
ts.pollFirst();         retrieves and removes the first(lowest) element or return null if empty
ts.poolLast();          retrieves and removes the last(highest) element or return null if empty
ts.decendingSet();      give decending order of elements
       
Queue(FIFO)             uc : prior to process

priority queue -> arrange elements based on priority

A priority queue is a type of queue that arranges elements based on their priority values. Elements with higher priority values are typically retrieved before elements with lower priority values.

-ascending priority queue
-decending priority queue



Here's a comparison of ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack in Java:

1. *ArrayList*: 
   - Implements the List interface backed by an array.
   - Offers fast random access and iteration.
   - Slower insertion and deletion operations compared to LinkedList.
   - Not synchronized, so not thread-safe by default.

2. *LinkedList*:
   - Implements the List and Deque interfaces using a doubly linked list.
   - Efficient for insertion and deletion operations, especially in the middle of the list.
   - Slower random access compared to ArrayList.
   - Not synchronized.

3. *Vector*:
   - Similar to ArrayList but synchronized, making it thread-safe.
   - Slower performance compared to ArrayList due to synchronization.
   - Less commonly used due to the overhead of synchronization.

4. *Stack*:
   - Extends Vector and implements the stack data structure.
   - Supports push and pop operations, with the top element being the last one added.
   - Largely superseded by the use of Deque implementations like ArrayDeque, which offer better performance and more 
     flexibility.

In summary:
- Choose ArrayList for fast random access and iteration when thread safety is not a concern.
- Choose LinkedList for efficient insertion and deletion, especially in the middle of the list.
- Use Vector only when thread safety is required, but be aware of the performance overhead.
- Consider using Deque implementations like ArrayDeque instead of Stack for stack operations due to better performance.




A HashSet is a collection in Java that uses hashing to store elements, providing constant-time performance for basic operations like add, remove, and contains.

A "LinkedIn hashset" isn't a standard term in Java. It might refer to a HashSet implementation specific to LinkedIn's engineering practices or frameworks.

A TreeSet is another collection in Java that stores elements in a sorted order defined either by natural ordering or by a comparator. It offers log(n) time complexity for basic operations but requires elements to be comparable.

In summary:
- Use HashSet when you need fast insertion, deletion, and membership testing, but don't need any specific order.
- Use TreeSet when you need elements to be sorted either naturally or by a custom comparator.
- A "LinkedIn hashset" would require more context to understand its specific characteristics and use cases.
