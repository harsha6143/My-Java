Lambda expressions can be stored in variables if the variable's type is an interface which has only one method. The lambda expression should have the same number of parameters and the same return type as that method. Java has many of these kinds of interfaces built in, such as the Consumer interface (found in the java.util package) used by lists.

interface Addable{
    int add(int a,int b);
}
class test {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int a=10;
        int b=20;
        Addable ad1=(x,y)->(x+y);
        int result =ad1.add(a,b);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
